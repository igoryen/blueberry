1. "many-year event" = mye,  "many-day event" = mde, "one-day event" = ode
2. // var todaysDates = [];
3. //  console.log( moment(warEvent.from))
4. // console.log(" typeof durationInYears: " + typeof durationInYears);
5. if the many-year event started before today or today i.e. if the -MM-DD of the event's start date are earlier than or the same as those of today's -MM-DD 
6. create a clone of the event where 
7. "from" = eventFullStartDate
8. "till" = year is the year when the event started, the month and day are December 31.
9. fyc = first year's clone
10. the middle year, the year that gets incremented with every year when creating a new clone for events that span over more than one year
11. var _nextYear = "";
12. var _endDate = eventStartDate;
13. // console.log( " next "+ eventStartDate.add(1, 'years').format("YYYY")); // 1942, 1943
14. wec = war event clone
15. // console.log("followingYear: " + followingYear);
16. add to the array
17. lyc = last year's clone
18.  if the many-year event started after today  i.e. if the -MM-DD of the event's start date are later than those of today's -MM-DD
19. // console.log("^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^" + dummyStartDate)
20. // var dummyEndDate   = moment().year(2000).month(eventEndMonth).day(eventEndDay);
21. var now = moment();
22. console.log("durationInYears: " + durationInYears);
23. console.log("++++++++++++++++++ : " + year);
24. collect the relevant events (i.e. those that today happen, begin, continue, or end)
25. display the collected events
26. If the event has an ending date that is not the same as the starting date, then the event lasts not one day but several days (a many-day event) and may possibly roll over to the New Year's Day into the next year.
27. Calculate the duration of the event in years, i.e. find out if the event rolls over to the next year.
28. If it is a many-year event, i.e. if it is found out that the event does roll over at least one year / at least one New Year's Day, 
29. Create a date that is 
30. // return wec;
31. If it is established that the event does not roll over a New Year's day even once, then it's simply a many-day event within the same year
32. If the event has no ending date, then the date doesn't last more than one day, it begins and ends on the same day, i.e. it is a one-day event
33. dummyStartDate is a date whose year = the current year and whose month and day are the ones of the event under consideration
